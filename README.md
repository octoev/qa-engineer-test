# QA Engineer technical task
This is a technical task for the QA Engineer role at Octopus EV. It aims to assess both your analytical skills and technical abilities by asking you to explore some existing functionality and to define the scenarios and test cases you discover whilst demonstrating how you can automate them.

## Instructions
- Explore the functionality of the [Cars](https://octopusev.com/cars) page and document the scenarios and test cases you discover.
- Using a testing framework such as [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) or [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), create automated tests for 1-2 of the scenarios you have discovered.
- Commit your code to a git repo with descriptive commit messages.
- Include a `README.md` file that includes your scenarios/test cases and how to run the automated tests.
- When you're finished, send along **one of the following** to the person that sent you the task:
  1. A zip of your project (complete with the `.git` folder)
  2. A link to a **private** repo (we will need to share which email addresses you need to add as collaborators)
  
## Success criteria
- Clarity & accuracy - are the tests easy to understand and do they capture the functionality accurately?
- Completeness - has all the main functionality been identified?
- Technical proficiency - do the automated tests work as expected and how easy will they be to maintain?
  
## Other considerations
- Don't test beyond the main `/cars` page e.g. no need to test individual car pages, the quote flow or common functionality within the navbar or footer.
- Aim to spend a maximum of 2-4 hours on this task. You can document anything else you might have done given more time.
- This is a new task so we really welcome any feedback you might have.
