# QA Engineer technical task
This is a technical task for the QA Engineer role at Octopus EV. It aims to assess both your analytical skills and technical abilities by asking you to explore some existing functionality and to define the scenarios and test cases you discover whilst demonstrating how you might automate them.

## Instructions
- Explore the functionality on the [Cars](https://octopusev.com/cars) page and document the test cases you discover.
- Using a testing framework such as [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) or [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), create automated tests for some of the functionality you have discovered.
- Commit your changes to a git repo with descriptive commit messages.
- Include a `README.md` file that includes your test cases and explains how to run the automated tests.
- Zip your project (complete with the `.git` folder) and send it to the person that sent you this task.
  
## Success criteria
- Clarity/accuracy - are the tests easy to understand?
- Completeness - has all the main functionality been discovered?
- Technical proficiency - do the automated tests work as expected and are they easy to understand and maintain?
  
## Other considerations
- Don't test beyond the main `/cars` page e.g. no need to test individual car pages, the quote flow or common functionality within the navbar or footer.
- Aim to spend a maximum of 2-4 hours on this task. You can document anything else you would have done given more time.
